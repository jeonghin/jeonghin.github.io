          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Malaysia is a country in Southeast Asia. The federal constitutional monarchy consists of 13 states and
            three federal territories, separated by the South China Sea into two regions: <strong>Peninsular
              Malaysia</strong> and
            <strong>Borneo's East Malaysia</strong>. <br><br>

            <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong> is the national capital, the country's largest city, and the seat of the
            legislative branch of the federal government. <strong>Putrajaya</strong> is the administrative centre, which
            represents the seat of both the executive branch (the Cabinet, federal ministries, and federal agencies) and
            the judicial branch of the federal government. <br><br>

            Politics of Malaysia takes place in the framework of a federal representative democratic constitutional
            monarchy, in
            which the <strong>Yang di-Pertuan Agong</strong> is head of state and the <strong>Prime Minister of
              Malaysia</strong> is the head of
            government. Executive
            power is exercised by the <strong>federal government</strong> and the <strong>13 state governments</strong>.
            Legislative power is vested in
            the <strong>federal
              parliament</strong> and the <strong>13 state assemblies</strong>. The judiciary is independent of the
            executive and the legislature,
            though the
            executive maintains a certain level of influence in the appointment of judges to the courts.<br><br>

            The Constitution of Malaysia is <strong>codified</strong> and the system of government is based on the
            <strong>Westminster system</strong>. The Parliament consists of the Dewan Negara (Upper House/Senate) and
            Dewan Rakyat (Lower House/House of Representatives). In general elections, registered voters <strong>vote
              for the
              members of the House of Representatives</strong> <br><br>

            The 15th General Election was held in Malaysia on <strong>Saturday, 19 November 2022</strong>. The prospect
            of snap
            elections had been considered high due to the <strong>political crisis</strong> that had been ongoing since
            2020; political instability caused by <strong>coalition</strong> or <strong>party switching</strong> among
            members of Parliament</strong>, combined with the fallout of the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>,
            contributed to the <strong>resignation of two prime ministers</strong> and the <strong>collapse of each of
              their respective coalition governments</strong> since the 2018 general elections.<br><br>

            The term of the 14th Parliament was due to expire on 16 July 2023, five years after its first meeting on 16
            July
            2018. However, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (<strong>King of Malaysia</strong>), Abdullah of Pahang,
            <strong>dissolved parliament</strong> at
            the request
            of <strong>Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob</strong> on 10 October 2022. Constitutionally, the elections
            were required to
            be held
            within 60 days of the dissolution, making 9 December the last possible polling day.

          <h2>Timeline</h2>
          <p>Malaysia has had a <strong>multi-party system</strong> since the first direct election of the Federal
            Legislative Council of
            Malaya in
            1955 on a <strong>first-past-the-post basis</strong>. The ruling party was the Alliance Party (Malay: Parti
            Perikatan)
            coalition and from
            1973 onwards, its successor, the Barisan Nasional (National Front) coalition. Together with its predecessor,
            the <strong>Barisan
              Nasional (BN)</strong> government served for 61 years and was <strong>one of the world's longest serving
              governments</strong> until it
            <strong>lost power</strong>
            to the <strong>Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition</strong> in the 14th general election that was held on 9 May
            2018.
            Following
            the <strong>2020–22
              Malaysian political crisis</strong>, the Perikatan Nasional government served from 1
            March 2020 to 17 August 2021
            when Barisan
            Nasional withdrew support and left the coalition.

              <h4>Dissolution of Parliament</h4>
              <h5>Oct 10, 2022</h5>
              <p>Ismail Sabri announced that the 14th Parliament had been dissolved to pave way for the upcoming 15th
                general election, which would be held within 60 days. On October 20, the Election Commission revealed
                the polling date for the 15th general election set on 19 November.

              <h4>Anti-hopping law</h4>
              <h5>Oct 3, 2022</h5>
              <p>In the Hous of Representatives, a constitutional amendment was passed. The King gave his consent to the
                Constitution (Amendment) Act (No. 3) 2022, which prohibits members of parliament from switching
                political parties.

              <h4>Bipartisan cooperation</h4>
              <h5>Sept 12, 2021</h5>
              <p>The government under <strong>Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob</strong> and the
                opposition led by
                <strong>Anwar Ibrahim</strong>
                reached an agreement to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on bipartisan cooperation to ensure
                political cooperation and stability amid the COVID-19 pandemic and stated that no elections would be
                held
                before July 31, 2022. This event
                marked a historic moment in Malaysian politics, as it was the
                first time such bipartisan cooperation had been formally established.

              <h5>Sept 10, 2021</h5>
              <p>The Malaysian cabinet approved several key reforms, including an
                <strong></strong>Anti-Party
                Hopping Bill</strong>, <strong>equal
                  membership in parliamentary committees</strong>, consultations on all bills, providing the
                <strong>Opposition Leader with
                  the same
                  amenities as a cabinet minister</strong>, limiting a <strong>prime minister's term to 10
                  years</strong>, and accelerating an
                amendment to <strong>allow
                  18-year-olds to vote</strong> and stand in elections. The opposition expressed its support for these
                reforms the
                following day,
                recognizing their importance for the nation.

                as the Prime Minister. An online petition opposing Ismail Sabri's appointment gained over 200,000

              <h5>Aug 17-20, 2021</h5>
              <p>The King met with MPs, asking them to send him their choice for next Prime Minister by 4pm on 18
                August. The National Palace received nominations for the future prime minister from 220 MPs, each
                through a statutory declaration on 18 August 2021. From the declaration letters, a total of 114
                MPs nominated Ismail Sabri, a sufficient majority to form the government. Following that, the
                King agreed to grant an audience with the 114 MPs to confirm their trust in Ismail Sabri who was
                nominated to be appointed as the next prime minister.</p>

              <p>Muhyiddin Yassin resigns as Prime Minister after failing to maintain a parliamentary majority. The

                UMNO's support for Muhyiddin as prime minister. Other UMNO members in the Cabinet also resigned from

                citing the COVID-19 pandemic and political instability as reasons. This <strong>suspends
                  Parliament</strong> and is met with criticism and claims of it being

          <h2>Census</h2>
          <p>As a politician, especially a candidate running for election, it is <strong>important to know the area and
              the
              people one
              serves</strong>. Even within the same state, different areas have different needs, income levels, and
            problems that
            must be
            addressed by elected representatives.

            <br><br>Therefore, the following census data is crucial for candidates running in the election, and for
            readers of this report
            to understand the rationale behind a party or coalition's decision to compete for a Constituency seat, or to
            nominate a
            specific candidate, especially when <strong>Malaysian voters remain divided along ethnic lines</strong>.

            <br><br>For example, if the majority of voters in Area A are of XYZ ethnicity, it would be beneficial for a
            party to nominate a
            local candidate who is also of XYZ ethnicity.

            <br><br>All Malaysians are categorized into three different income groups: the Top 20% (T20), Middle 40%
            (M40), and Bottom 40% (B40). The classification threshold is based on the Malaysian Department of
            Statistics' (DOSM) Household Income and Basic Amenities (HIS/BA) survey. Since the data used was the 2020
            census data, I used DOSM's 2019 threshold to define the income groups, where <strong>B40</strong> is less
            than RM 4850, <strong>M40</strong>
            is RM 4850 - RM 10959, and <strong>T20</strong> is RM 10960 and more.

            <br><br>For the Bumiputera Population, I categorized this variable into 4 groups: Small, Medium, Large, and
            Extra-Large. In this dataset, <strong>Bumiputera</strong> includes the Malays, the Orang Asli of Peninsular
            Malaysia, and
            various indigenous peoples of East Malaysia as <strong>defined by the National Registration Department of
              Malaysia</strong>.
            <strong>Small</strong> is proportion less than 50%; <strong>Medium</strong> is between 50% to 65%
            (inclusive); <strong>Large</strong> is between 65% to 90%
            (inclusive); and <strong>Extra-Large</strong> is greater than 90%.

          <h2>Manifestos</h2>
          <p>During the <strong>campaign period</strong>, political parties or coalitions will come up with
            <strong>various manifestos and
              slogans</strong> to gain support from the voters. The 15th General Election was the first in which
            18–20-year-olds
            were eligible to vote, following a constitutional amendment reducing the voting age from 21 to 18.
            Additionally, all voters were automatically registered, so the <strong>electorate expanded by around six
              million
              people</strong> or 31%. <br><br>
            The following are the <strong>manifesto themes</strong> for the four political coalitions introduced in this

          <p>In the general election, no individual alliance won the required 112 seats needed for a majority in the
            Dewan Rakyat to
            form the next government. On 22 November, days after the election, none of the coalition leaders were able
            to get a simple majority of 112 seats, so the King summoned Anwar Ibrahim (PH's leader) and Muhyiddin Yassin
            (PN's leader) to meet him. The King proposed a unity government, but PN rejected the idea of working with
            PH. <br><br>

            On 23 November, the King met with BN and GPS leaders in the royal palace. The next day, UMNO's supreme
            council agreed to follow the wishes of the King for BN to join a unity government, but the condition is that
            the unity government must not be led by PN. DAP politicians of the PH coalition apologized publicly to the
            Sarawak government and Sarawak people over past misunderstandings and called for a fresh start to cooperate
            together. Later on 24 November, the Royal Palace announced that PH chairman Anwar Ibrahim was appointed as
            Prime Minister by the King as Anwar has received support from MPs from PH, BN, GPS, Warisan, MUDA and PBM,
            as well as independent MPs. <br><br>

            On 25 November, GRS had joined the unity government, supporting Anwar; this resulted in Anwar becoming the
            first prime minister since 2008 to have two-thirds majority support in Parliament. Muhyiddin congratulated
            and thanked Anwar for inviting PN to join the unity government, and declined Anwar's invitation, stating
            that PN would play the role of a "credible opposition" to ensure "corruption-free governance". <br><br>
